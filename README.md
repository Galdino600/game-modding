# [The Ultimate Tutorial And Resources For Game Modding](https://github.com/Galdino600/game-modding)

***A curated list of tools, tutorials, and much more for editing video games!***

## Introduction
Welcome to the most comprehensive, single game modding list, without the bullshit tutorials to modify just a few games, from a specific engine; not here! Here I will explain how to modify any game and enter its core and modify it. I will show you tools, resources and tutorials and also explain the difference between different types of modifications in video games.

One repository that I highly recommend for decompilers, or reverse engineering games, is [Game Hacking Resource](https://github.com/dsasmblr/game-hacking/blob/master/README.md).

## Theory Of The Game Modding

### Types Of Modding

Type Name | Description
---- | ----
**Framework Modding** | *Basically it is modifying games in a dynamic way, adding new assets in the game, adding new dynamics or new files that compromise the compiled script of the game. Ex: Adding a shooting dynamic in Driver 2; adding a nuclear bomb system in Victoria 2.*
**Archive Modding** | *It is modification and replacement only of files that already exist in the game, such as images, texts, animations, etc. This form can be sorted generically (all games) using easy tools or by modifying files where the game didn't compile.*
**Unique Modding** | *They are the use of specific tools for modifying just one game, it can be big (add new mechanics) or small (just change images, texts...).*
**Engine Modding** | *This type can be creating a tool to edit files where the engine creates or relates to the composition of the game. An example of this is DnSpy, which is an 86x assembly tool for editing Unity game dynamics.*

### Websites For Modding

Site Name | Link | Description
---- | ---- | ----
**ModDb** | [ModDb](https://www.moddb.com/) | *One of the most classic and oldest Game Modding sites. Despite being very complete, I don't recommend it very much because it's a site that only uses the official methods of each game for modification.*
**Nexus Mods** | [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/) | ...



*Being implemented...*
