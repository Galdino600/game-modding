# [The Ultimate Tutorial And Resources For Game Modding](https://github.com/Galdino600/game-modding)

***A curated list of tools, tutorials, and much more for editing video games!***

## Introduction
Welcome to the most comprehensive, single game modding list, without the bullshit tutorials to modify just a few games, from a specific engine; not here! Here I will explain how to modify any game and enter its core and modify it. I will show you tools, resources and tutorials and also explain the difference between different types of modifications in video games.

One repository that I highly recommend for decompilers, or reverse engineering games, is [Game Hacking Resource](https://github.com/dsasmblr/game-hacking/blob/master/README.md).
